#problem
Every household has a box of general medicines/specific medicines that are present for our consumption. While the medicine is purchased, we make it a point to check the date of expiry, however over a period of time we ignore to validate if the medicines available in our house are still under the period of expiry. Question: Leverage technology to ensure that we have an easy mechanism to identify which of the medicines are still okay for consumption
#Detailed_problem
Scenario #1 The person forgets the expiry date and expired medicines are still present in the medicine box and can't be known to be restocked
Scenario #2 The person forgets to register the expiry date while the time of buying totally. Therefore the medicine can't be deemed valid at any point
Scenario #3 The person searches for a medicine from the box but is unsure of the validity of the medicine even in urgency
